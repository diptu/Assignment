#PHP/Laravel summary
This application shows a simple demonstration of a movie review app using Laravel.

This application consists of basic routing like Home View, Login View Registration View, Film List View , Film Detail View, Film Create View.
User authentication uses laravel built-in user model.
Access control of pages like only Logged in user can posts comment. Or add a new film (can be further improved so that only superuser can add/create a new film)
Unique Slug field generated for each film and uses this slug field to route in URL.
First, TestSeeder  have been used to seed the database for testing.
Image file size have been limited to 2mb purposely as many apache serve has that as a max limit.

This is a application can be further improved in many ways. This work is only for demonstration purpose.
